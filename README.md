## Take Home Problem 2
This is a Python 2 project that will take input from a barcode reader (hopefully in the form of a UPC code and a return).  It interfaces with the Walmart product lookup API to get info on items based on UPC.  

### How to Use (On Mac)
1. Download the `project-2` folder from this repository
1. Open up **Terminal**
1. `cd` to the `project-2` folder
1. run wal.py using Python 2
   * on my computer, I type `python wal.py`, but it may be `python2 wal.py` depending on how you have your versions installed
1. Proceed to enter UPC codes
   * they should be separated by a new line
1. To Quit: enter `Ctrl+D` or close the **Terminal** window

### Possible improvements
* GUI that would separate input and output screens
* UPC checking - so that we don't have to wait for a 404 code
* A user-friendly way to quit
